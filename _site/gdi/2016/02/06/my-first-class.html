<p>Today I am preparing to teach Introduction into Programming with Ruby, aka Intro to Ruby, for the <a target="_blank" href="www.gdidayton.com">GDI Dayton Chapter</a>. I’m beyond excited and nervous.</p>

<p>We needed at least 7 ladies to sign up for the class to go on, but by deadline time only 6 had. I asked to keep registration open and to go on anyways. We’ve had 3 more ladies sign up in the last 48 hours!</p>

<p>I also have been asked to think about teaching the Cincy ladies Ruby in the spring. So overwhelming! So exciting!</p>

<p>Did I mention that I also plan on starting a new job here in March?!? A lot of the reason I wanted to reach out more into the community around here was due to boredom at work and such. In the past 6 months alone I’ve done so many new things. I’ve gotten so many new oppertunites to do the things I want to do.</p>

<p>This is where most would say they feel super blessed, but those who know me know I’m not very religous. So I’ll say I feel super pumped to be me right now in this place.</p>
