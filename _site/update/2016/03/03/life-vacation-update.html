<p>I’ve been off work for about 2 weeks now. I have to say it is pretty amazing, but I am super excited to get back at it. So excited that I’ve been playing on code school for the past two days. Speaking of which, this weekend code school is having a free coding weekend!.</p>

<p>I’ve been playing through the advanced javascript courses, working up to node.js, Angular.js, and ember.js. All things I hope to do in my new job. Speaking of which, I start next week, so exciting!</p>

<p>While I’ve been home I’ve organized lots of things! If you follow my snapchat you saw I went to town with space bags. If you follow my snapchat you also saw I spend a lot of time with my cats. They are going to be so upset when I go back to work.</p>

<p>Today we are hopefully biting the bullet and buying Kevin a car! He’s getting a VW Golf S, don’t really mind him getting the new car. He deserves it, but I’m glad its the S and not a GTI. Then I’d be jealous and it’s too much HP!</p>

<p>Completed teaching <a href="http://kcjonesevans.github.io/gdidayton-intro-ruby">Introduction To Programming with Ruby</a> this past Saturday. I had a blast teaching it, and I think the last class was my favorite. We went over classes in depth and built a lot of fun snippets of code.</p>
