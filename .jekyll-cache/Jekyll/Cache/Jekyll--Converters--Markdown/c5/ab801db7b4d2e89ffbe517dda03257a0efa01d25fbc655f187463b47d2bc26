I"™<p>This coming week is my last week of work at my current job. I am leaving behind a work wife and many many friends, but most importantly Iâ€™m leaving a job that took me nowhere.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m pretty excited about leaving, even though Iâ€™ll miss my work wife and work moms a ton! Iâ€™m excited to move my career forward again, I feel this was my job to figure out what it is that I really wanted to do. The boring monotony of these past 2 years has given me a chance to really focus on me. I feel like I grew SO much.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve learned I really am a strong, independent women with the best husband who is the most supportive person ever. I learned I really like web development, as much as I love the solving of bug issues in older code. Web development provides me with a quick turn around and instant gratification. But first vacation time, getting some stuff done, doing some side projects before I start!</p>
