I'm K.C. Jones-Evans and I am a software developer with Applied Information Sciences (AIS).

I got my a B.S. in Computer Science from Wright State Univeristy and have over 6 years of experience in the complete development cycle of software, from initial requirement gathering to maintenance of completed systems.

You can find me spending my evenings at Girl Develop It Dayton functions,  lifting all the weights at Dayton Strength and Conditioning, or cuddling on the couch with my cats.
